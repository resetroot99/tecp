# TECP Complete Roadmap: Protocol to Global Standard
## Making TECP the TLS of Ephemeral Computation

---

## üéØ **Strategic Vision**

**Goal**: Make TECP the cryptographic receipt layer of the internet - minimal, provable, boring-to-use, impossible-to-ignore.

**Principle**: Protocol-first, never product. You don't "sell TECP" - you prove it exists and let the ecosystem build on it.

---

## üìÖ **Phase 1: Lock Core + Proof of Concept (0-3 months)**

### **Objective**: Freeze the primitive. Show TECP receipts are real, fast, verifiable.

### **Core Protocol (v0.1 FROZEN)**
```
‚úÖ Receipt schema locked
   - 9 required fields: version, code_ref, ts, nonce, input_hash, output_hash, policy_ids, sig, pubkey
   - Extensions: key_erasure, environment, log_inclusion
   - CBOR + Ed25519 deterministic signing

‚úÖ Policy registry published
   - Machine IDs mapped to compliance frameworks
   - GDPR/HIPAA/PCI direct mappings
   - JSON schema with validation rules

‚úÖ KATs (Known Answer Tests)
   - 3 test vectors: valid, invalid sig, expired
   - Byte-exact CBOR expected outputs
   - Cross-implementation verification
```

### **Reference Verifier**
```
‚úÖ CLI verifier
   - tecp verify receipt.json ‚Üí ‚úÖ/‚ùå + error details
   - --require-log mode for transparency verification
   - Performance: <5ms verification on laptop

‚úÖ Web verifier  
   - Drag-and-drop receipt validation
   - Zero dependencies, works offline
   - No branding - looks like a boring utility

‚úÖ Fuzz testing
   - Bad receipts corpus (invalid sigs, malformed CBOR)
   - Property-based testing with random inputs
   - Edge case documentation
```

### **Transparency Log**
```
‚úÖ Production implementation
   - SQLite ‚Üí Postgres for scale
   - Merkle tree with inclusion proofs
   - 3 endpoints: /entries, /proof/:leaf, /root

‚úÖ Signed roots
   - Ed25519 signature on tree roots
   - Timestamped commitments
   - External witnessing (optional)

‚úÖ Receipt integration
   - log_inclusion field in receipts
   - Automatic submission on creation
   - Verification includes log proof check
```

### **Killer Demo: Multi-Provider Private AI**
```
‚úÖ Universal AI proxy
   - /v1/chat/completions ‚Üí response + receipt
   - DeepSeek (default), OpenAI, Anthropic, local models
   - Provider switching without code changes

‚úÖ Policy enforcement visible
   - no_retention, key_erasure policies in receipts
   - Environment metadata (region, provider)
   - Health check shows policy compliance

‚úÖ Immediate verification
   - Demo receipt ‚Üí CLI verification in <5ms
   - Web verifier link in response
   - Anyone can independently validate
```

### **Positioning Strategy**
```
‚úÖ Protocol documentation
   - PROTOCOL.md published (RFC-style, boring)
   - THREAT_MODEL.md (conservative claims)
   - SPEC_VERSIONING.md (backward compatibility)

‚úÖ Open governance
   - "TECP isn't a product ‚Äî it's a protocol"
   - Apache 2.0 code, CC BY 4.0 spec
   - GitHub issues for community input
```

**üî• Phase 1 Outcome**: TECP receipts exist, verifiers work, one demo proves it's real.

- ‚ùå **Too product-y**: Just another SaaS, not infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Protocol-first**: Becomes internet infrastructure

### **Creates Inevitable Adoption**
- **Phase 1**: Proves TECP works
- **Phase 2**: Shows it's not just one team
- **Phase 3**: Makes it feel like a standard  
- **Phase 4**: Makes it actually boring infrastructure

### **Business Strategy Alignment**
- **Open protocol**: Enables ecosystem growth
- **Commercial services**: Funds development
- **Platform business**: Scales with adoption
- **Infrastructure play**: Becomes acquisition target

---

## üöÄ **Execution Strategy**

### **Development Focus**

- **Months 4-6**: Prove ecosystem (multiple SDKs, demos)
- **Months 7-12**: Drive adoption (standards, enterprise)
- **Months 13-24**: Achieve ubiquity (browsers, clouds)

### **Community Building**
- **Academic engagement**: Security conferences, peer review
- **Industry outreach**: Cloud providers, compliance vendors
- **Developer adoption**: Clear docs, easy integration
- **Standards participation**: IETF, W3C, industry bodies

### **Market Positioning**
