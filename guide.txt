Absolutely‚Äîhere‚Äôs a revised, UI-first execution plan that starts by making the front end a pure technical reference: simple, no emojis, no marketing‚Äîjust an informational verifier + sandbox that real developers can trust and reuse.

üìÖ 12-Week Plan (UI-first, lean, professional)

Weeks 1‚Äì2 ‚Äî Refactor the UI into a Reference Surface

Goal: A minimal, standards-style site that proves TECP with zero fluff.

Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	Pages (routes)
	‚Ä¢	/ Overview ‚Äî 300‚Äì500 words: purpose, the Receipt object, links to spec/test vectors.
	‚Ä¢	/verify Reference Verifier ‚Äî paste/upload/URL fetch; plain results with exact error codes.
	‚Ä¢	/examples Sandbox ‚Äî runnable examples (curl, Node, Python) and a ‚Äútry it‚Äù box that hits your demo endpoint and shows Receipt + verification inline.
	‚Ä¢	/policies Policy Registry ‚Äî table of policy IDs ‚Üí machine rules, version, status.
	‚Ä¢	/log Transparency Log ‚Äî table (leaf index, receipt hash, code_ref) + fetch proof.
	‚Ä¢	Design system (one tiny CSS file)
	‚Ä¢	System font stack, light theme only, high contrast.
	‚Ä¢	Layout: max-width container (70‚Äì80ch), 16px base, 1.5 line height.
	‚Ä¢	Components: <Section>, <Card>, <Table>, <CodeBlock>, <FormField>, <Alert>.
	‚Ä¢	Monospace for hashes and receipts.
	‚Ä¢	No icons, gradients, animations.
	‚Ä¢	Verifier UX (boring by design)
	‚Ä¢	Inputs: Textarea, File input (.json/.cbor), URL input.
	‚Ä¢	Output: PASS/FAIL header + table:
	‚Ä¢	Signature: Valid/Invalid
	‚Ä¢	Timestamp: OK/Skew/Expired
	‚Ä¢	Schema: OK/Path to failing field
	‚Ä¢	Transparency log: Included/Not found/Root mismatch
	‚Ä¢	Exact error codes (e.g., E-SIG-001, E-TS-002, E-AGE-003, E-SCHEMA-004).
	‚Ä¢	Sandbox on /examples
	‚Ä¢	Left: code snippets (curl/Node/Python).
	‚Ä¢	Right: request/response panel that:
	‚Ä¢	Sends request to your demo endpoint
	‚Ä¢	Shows raw output and tecp_receipt (JSON)
	‚Ä¢	Auto-verifies and prints the same PASS/FAIL table

Acceptance criteria
	‚Ä¢	No images/emojis/marketing copy; all text selectable.
	‚Ä¢	Copy-paste friendly code blocks; consistent monospace.
	‚Ä¢	Verifier (web) returns identical error codes as CLI for same input.
	‚Ä¢	Lighthouse Accessibility ‚â• 95; no client-side state required to view results.

‚∏ª

Weeks 3‚Äì4 ‚Äî Freeze the Contract & Make Verification Reproducible

Goal: Devs can reproduce your results byte-for-byte.

Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	Spec artifacts
	‚Ä¢	PROTOCOL.md (RFC-style, short): fields, canonical encoding, failure modes.
	‚Ä¢	THREAT_MODEL.md: what‚Äôs in/out of scope; key-erasure framing.
	‚Ä¢	SPEC_VERSIONING.md: semver and deprecation policy.
	‚Ä¢	Known-Answer Tests (KATs)
	‚Ä¢	spec/test-vectors/ with 3 receipts:
	‚Ä¢	Valid
	‚Ä¢	Expired
	‚Ä¢	Bad signature
	‚Ä¢	Provide both JSON view and canonical CBOR bytes + expected outcomes.
	‚Ä¢	CLI/Web parity
	‚Ä¢	/verify shows the exact CLI command used internally.
	‚Ä¢	JSON API: POST /verify {receipt} ‚Üí {valid, errors[], details}.

Acceptance criteria
	‚Ä¢	Two machines verify the same receipt ‚Üí same result and same error codes.
	‚Ä¢	CI runs KATs for web + CLI + core library.
	‚Ä¢	Max receipt size ‚â§ 8 KB; creation < 10 ms, verify < 5 ms documented.

‚∏ª

Weeks 5‚Äì6 ‚Äî Transparency & Build Trust Hooks

Goal: Independent verifiability beyond your server.

Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	Transparency log (minimal, hardened)
	‚Ä¢	Endpoints: POST /entries, GET /proof/:leaf, GET /root.
	‚Ä¢	Signed root; inclusion proofs; simple /log UI.
	‚Ä¢	Build reproducibility
	‚Ä¢	BUILDINFO generator: emits code_ref, toolchain hash, deps hash.
	‚Ä¢	Sign BUILDINFO with project key; link from / and show on /verify when present.
	‚Ä¢	Policy registry wiring
	‚Ä¢	/policies: show ID, machine rule (e.g., ttl<=5000ms, region==EU), version.
	‚Ä¢	Verifier flags unknown policy IDs.

Acceptance criteria
	‚Ä¢	Verifier can require inclusion proof (--require-log flag & UI toggle).
	‚Ä¢	/log shows proof path and signed root; verifier validates path to root.

‚∏ª

Weeks 7‚Äì8 ‚Äî SDKs & Minimal Second Demo

Goal: Onboard outside developers without changing the UI surface.

Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	SDKs
	‚Ä¢	Python and Rust SDKs that pass KATs (JS is reference).
	‚Ä¢	One-page docs per SDK with copy/paste examples.
	‚Ä¢	Second demo (small, dev-centric)
	‚Ä¢	Ephemeral Chat: plain web form; each send returns {message, receipt}; verify inline.
	‚Ä¢	Keep UI identical to Private-GPT: just a different endpoint.

Acceptance criteria
	‚Ä¢	Interop suite validates: JS ‚Üî Python ‚Üî Rust create/verify the same test vectors.
	‚Ä¢	Demos share the same receipt rendering and verifier components (no new UI).

‚∏ª

Weeks 9‚Äì10 ‚Äî Compliance Hooks & Auditor Tool

Goal: Make it useful for regulated teams without UI bloat.

Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	Policy set expansion
	‚Ä¢	Curate ~10 policy IDs mapped to GDPR/HIPAA/PCI sections.
	‚Ä¢	Document mapping in policy-registry.json.
	‚Ä¢	Auditor CLI
	‚Ä¢	tecp audit receipt.json --policy hipaa_safe
	‚Ä¢	Mirrors verifier output; plain text and JSON.
	‚Ä¢	UI additions (no frills)
	‚Ä¢	/examples adds ‚Äúauditor mode‚Äù snippet outputs (copy/paste only).

Acceptance criteria
	‚Ä¢	Auditor relies solely on receipt + policy registry (no hidden logic).
	‚Ä¢	All outputs remain text-only; no new visual components.

‚∏ª

Weeks 11‚Äì12 ‚Äî Governance & Standards Posture

Goal: Position TECP as a protocol, not a product.

Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	Governance
	‚Ä¢	CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
	‚Ä¢	Open ‚ÄúTECP Working Group‚Äù README with decision process.
	‚Ä¢	Draft Internet-Draft
	‚Ä¢	Convert PROTOCOL.md to an I-D skeleton (Abstract, Terminology, Message Formats, Security Considerations).
	‚Ä¢	Host drafts in /spec/drafts/.
	‚Ä¢	Adoption kit
	‚Ä¢	One-page ‚ÄúHow to integrate TECP into your API‚Äù (no sales language).
	‚Ä¢	curl + minimal server middleware example for Express/FastAPI/Actix.

Acceptance criteria
	‚Ä¢	External contributors can reproduce KATs and pass CI on first try.
	‚Ä¢	Draft spec builds with xml2rfc (or Markdown variant) without warnings.

‚∏ª

Implementation Notes (keep it lean)
	‚Ä¢	Tech choices
	‚Ä¢	Keep current stack; extract a tiny ui-kit (just layout, table, code block).
	‚Ä¢	Use CBOR + COSE_Sign1 for signatures; JSON only for display.
	‚Ä¢	Strict TypeScript types; zod or JSON Schema for input validation.
	‚Ä¢	Content style
	‚Ä¢	Short sentences, active voice, technical tone.
	‚Ä¢	No metaphors, no emojis, no marketing.
	‚Ä¢	Show raw artifacts first; explanations after.
	‚Ä¢	Testing
	‚Ä¢	Snapshot tests for UI tables to avoid drift.
	‚Ä¢	Property tests for canonicalization (same bytes in = same bytes out).
	‚Ä¢	Fuzz receivers with malformed CBOR and oversized inputs.
	‚Ä¢	Accessibility
	‚Ä¢	Labels for all inputs; visible focus outlines.
	‚Ä¢	Table headers; ARIA regions minimal but correct.
	‚Ä¢	Keyboard only flows verified.

‚∏ª

‚ÄúDone‚Äù Definition for the UI
	‚Ä¢	Anyone can: paste a receipt ‚Üí see exact verification reasons ‚Üí copy a CLI command to reproduce.
	‚Ä¢	Every example on /examples can be run as shown and produces a receipt that passes verification.
	‚Ä¢	The same rendering is used across all demos; no duplicated UI.

‚∏ª

TL;DR

Start by making the UI a standards-style reference: five plain pages, one stylesheet, identical outputs between web and CLI, and an example sandbox that shows real receipts and their verification. Then layer in logging, SDKs, compliance hooks, and governance‚Äîwithout changing the surface. That‚Äôs how you get something developers trust and others can build on immediately.
