# TECP Phase 1 Completion Checklist
## Lock Core + Proof of Concept (Next 4-6 weeks)

### ðŸ”’ **Protocol Freeze Tasks**

#### **Formal Documentation** (Week 3)
- [ ] **PROTOCOL.md**: RFC-style specification (boring, technical)
  - Receipt format specification
  - CBOR encoding rules
  - Ed25519 signature process
  - Verification algorithm
  - Error handling

- [ ] **THREAT_MODEL.md**: Conservative claims document
  - What TECP proves (ephemeral design, policy enforcement)
  - What TECP does NOT prove (RAM wipe, side-channels)
  - Security assumptions and boundaries
  - Attack vectors addressed vs not addressed

- [ ] **SPEC_VERSIONING.md**: Backward compatibility policy
  - Semantic versioning for receipts
  - Extension point guidelines
  - Migration strategies

#### **Testing & Validation** (Week 4)
- [ ] **Fuzz Testing Suite**
  - Malformed CBOR inputs
  - Invalid signature edge cases
  - Timestamp boundary conditions
  - Policy ID validation

- [ ] **Bad Receipts Corpus**
  - 50+ invalid receipt examples
  - Expected error messages
  - Edge case documentation

- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Receipt creation: <10ms target
  - Receipt verification: <5ms target
  - Transparency log insertion: <100ms
  - Memory usage profiling

#### **Governance Foundation** (Week 5)
- [ ] **TECP Working Group Charter**
  - GitHub organization setup
  - Open mailing list creation
  - Community contribution guidelines
  - Decision-making process

- [ ] **Licensing Clarity**
  - Apache 2.0 for code
  - CC BY 4.0 for specifications
  - Patent grant language
  - Commercial use guidelines

### ðŸŽ¯ **Positioning Strategy**

#### **"Protocol, Not Product" Messaging**
- [ ] Website: tecp.dev (boring, technical, no marketing fluff)
- [ ] Tagline: "Cryptographic receipts for ephemeral computation"
- [ ] No company branding - just protocol documentation

#### **Academic Credibility**
- [ ] Submit to security conferences (USENIX Security, CCS)
- [ ] Engage cryptography researchers for review
- [ ] University partnership discussions

### ðŸ”¥ **Phase 1 Success Criteria**
- [ ] 100% test vector pass rate across implementations
- [ ] <5ms receipt verification performance
- [ ] 1,000+ demo receipts generated and verified
- [ ] 5+ external contributors to specification
- [ ] Security researcher feedback incorporated

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks to complete Phase 1
**Budget**: $50K-100K (mostly developer time)
**Risk**: Low - building on solid foundation
