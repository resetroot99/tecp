# TECP Phase 3: Position as Standard
## Transition from cool tech → infrastructure nobody can ignore

### 🔬 **Protocol Evolution**

#### **TECP Profile System**
```
TECP-0 (Software): Current implementation
├── Ed25519 signatures
├── Software key erasure simulation
└── Policy enforcement through design

TECP-B (Bronze - Hardware Backed):
├── Intel SGX attestation integration
├── AMD SEV-SNP support  
├── ARM TrustZone compatibility
└── Hardware root of trust in receipts

TECP-G (Gold - Math Backed):
├── RISC Zero zkVM integration
├── Circom circuit support
├── Recursive proof composition
└── Pure mathematical guarantees
```

#### **Profile Negotiation**
- [ ] Automatic fallback: TECP-G → TECP-B → TECP-0
- [ ] Client preference specification
- [ ] Performance vs security tradeoffs
- [ ] Cost optimization algorithms

### 🔗 **Workflow Support**

#### **Multi-Step Workflows**
- [ ] Chain of custody across steps
- [ ] Merkle DAG of receipt dependencies
- [ ] Data flow verification
- [ ] Composite receipt generation

#### **Workflow Examples**
```
Healthcare Workflow:
Patient Data → Anonymization → AI Analysis → Report Generation
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  Receipt₁ →    Receipt₂ →    Receipt₃ →    Receipt₄
                                ↓
                        Composite Receipt
                    (Single hash = entire workflow)
```

### 🏢 **Enterprise & Compliance**

#### **Regulatory Mapping**
- [ ] GDPR articles → TECP policy IDs
- [ ] HIPAA safeguards → receipt verification
- [ ] PCI requirements → cryptographic proofs
- [ ] SOX compliance → audit trail automation

#### **Compliance Tooling**
- [ ] Automated audit trail generation
- [ ] Receipt-based compliance reporting
- [ ] Regulatory submission formats
- [ ] Risk assessment dashboards

#### **Enterprise Features**
- [ ] Receipt volume monitoring
- [ ] Policy violation detection
- [ ] Integration with compliance frameworks
- [ ] SSO and access control

### 🎓 **Academic & Standards Engagement**

#### **IETF Submission**
- [ ] Draft RFC for TECP-0.1 specification
- [ ] Internet-Draft publication
- [ ] Working group formation
- [ ] Standards track progression

#### **Academic Partnerships**
- [ ] University research collaborations
- [ ] Peer-reviewed security analysis
- [ ] Formal verification studies
- [ ] PhD thesis topics

#### **Industry Standardization**
- [ ] Cloud provider engagement
- [ ] Security vendor integration
- [ ] Standards body participation
- [ ] Industry consortium formation

### 📊 **Market Positioning**

#### **"New Trust Layer" Narrative**
```
1990s: HTTP (insecure) → HTTPS/TLS (secure transport)
2020s: Computation (opaque) → TECP (verifiable ephemeral)

Position: "TECP is to computation what TLS is to communication"
```

#### **Industry Validation**
- [ ] Major cloud provider pilot
- [ ] Fortune 500 enterprise trial
- [ ] Government agency evaluation
- [ ] Academic institution adoption

### 🎯 **Phase 3 Success Metrics**
- [ ] IETF Internet-Draft submission
- [ ] 1+ major cloud provider integration
- [ ] 10+ enterprise pilot customers
- [ ] 100+ daily receipt generation
- [ ] Media coverage in tech press

**Timeline**: 6 months (standards process is slow)
**Budget**: $500K-1M (standards engagement + enterprise sales)
**Risk**: High - depends on industry acceptance
