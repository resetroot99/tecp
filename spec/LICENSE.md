# TECP Licensing

## Dual Licensing Structure

TECP uses a dual licensing structure to enable both open collaboration and commercial adoption:

### Code License: Apache 2.0

All code in the following directories is licensed under **Apache License 2.0**:
- `packages/` - Core implementation packages
- `services/` - Service implementations  
- `demo/` - Demonstration applications
- `scripts/` - Development and testing scripts

**Apache 2.0 License Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Commercial use permitted
- ‚úÖ Modification and redistribution allowed
- ‚úÖ Patent grants included for implementation safety
- ‚úÖ Compatible with most enterprise software policies

**Full License**: https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

### Specification License: CC BY 4.0

All specification files in `spec/` are licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International**:
- `spec/PROTOCOL.md` - Core protocol specification
- `spec/THREAT_MODEL.md` - Security and threat model
- `spec/policy-registry.json` - Policy definitions and compliance mappings
- `spec/test-vectors.json` - Interoperability test vectors

**CC BY 4.0 License Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Commercial implementation allowed
- ‚úÖ Modification and adaptation permitted
- ‚úÖ Attribution-only requirement (no copyleft)
- ‚úÖ Standards-friendly licensing

**Full License**: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

## Commercial Use Guidelines

### ‚úÖ Permitted Commercial Activities

#### **Implementation and Deployment**
- Build commercial TECP-compatible services
- Deploy TECP in enterprise environments
- Integrate TECP into proprietary software products
- Offer TECP-based SaaS services

#### **Modification and Distribution**
- Modify TECP code for specific use cases
- Distribute modified versions (with attribution)
- Create derivative works and extensions
- Bundle with commercial software

#### **Patent Protection**
- Apache 2.0 provides patent grants from contributors
- Defensive patent termination clause included
- Safe for enterprise adoption and implementation

### üìã Attribution Requirements

#### **For Code (Apache 2.0)**
- Include Apache 2.0 license text in distributions
- Preserve copyright notices in source files
- Document any modifications made

#### **For Specification (CC BY 4.0)**
- Credit "TECP Protocol Contributors" in documentation
- Link to original specification source
- Indicate if changes were made to specification

### ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

#### **Code Contributions**
- All code contributions licensed under Apache 2.0
- Contributors retain copyright to their contributions
- Apache 2.0 patent grants apply to all contributions

#### **Specification Contributions**
- All specification contributions licensed under CC BY 4.0
- Collaborative editing and improvement encouraged
- Attribution to all contributors maintained

## License Compatibility

### ‚úÖ Compatible Licenses
- **MIT License**: Code can be combined
- **BSD Licenses**: Full compatibility
- **MPL 2.0**: Can be combined in larger works
- **GPL v3**: Apache 2.0 code can be included in GPL projects

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potentially Incompatible
- **GPL v2**: May have compatibility issues (consult legal counsel)
- **Proprietary**: Check specific license terms

### ‚ùå Incompatible Licenses
- **GPL with additional restrictions**: Not compatible
- **Copyleft licenses with attribution requirements**: May conflict

## Trademark and Branding

### **TECP Protocol Name**
- "TECP" and "Trusted Ephemeral Computation Protocol" are descriptive terms
- No trademark restrictions on protocol name usage
- Implementations may use "TECP-compatible" designation

### **Implementation Branding**
- Use your own branding for commercial implementations
- Clearly indicate TECP compatibility and version support
- Follow standard protocol naming conventions

## Enterprise Adoption

### **Legal Review Recommendations**
- Apache 2.0 is widely accepted by enterprise legal teams
- CC BY 4.0 is standards-friendly and non-restrictive
- Patent grants provide additional protection for implementers

### **Compliance Considerations**
- License compliance is straightforward (attribution only)
- No copyleft obligations or source disclosure requirements
- Compatible with most corporate open source policies

### **Support and Warranties**
- Open source software provided "as is" without warranties
- Commercial support may be available from contributors
- Enterprise implementations should include appropriate testing and validation

## Governance and Evolution

### **Specification Evolution**
- Community-driven development process
- Transparent decision-making for protocol changes
- Backward compatibility maintained where possible

### **Code Evolution**
- Standard open source development practices
- Pull request review process
- Semantic versioning for releases

### **License Updates**
- License changes require community consensus
- Existing code remains under original license terms
- Future versions may adopt updated license versions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: Can I use TECP in my commercial product?**
A: Yes, both the code (Apache 2.0) and specification (CC BY 4.0) permit commercial use with minimal attribution requirements.

### **Q: Do I need to open source my TECP implementation?**
A: No, there are no copyleft requirements. You can keep your implementation proprietary while remaining compliant.

### **Q: Can I modify the TECP protocol for my specific needs?**
A: Yes, you can modify both code and specification. Attribution to the original work is required, but you can create proprietary extensions.

### **Q: Are there patent risks with TECP implementation?**
A: Apache 2.0 includes patent grants from contributors, providing protection for standard implementations. Always consult legal counsel for specific situations.

### **Q: Can I trademark my TECP-based service?**
A: Yes, you can trademark your specific service or product name. The TECP protocol name itself is descriptive and not subject to trademark restrictions.
